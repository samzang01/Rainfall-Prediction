**Abstract**

Rainfall prediction is crucial for environmental monitoring, hydropower operations, and agricultural planning. This project aims to develop a robust rainfall prediction system using machine learning algorithms trained on meteorological data from the Punatsangchu Power Project. Through systematic data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the project demonstrates the application of algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree. The Random Forest model performed best with an RMSE of approximately 18.4 mm. The system, once deployed, can significantly contribute to effective water resource management and disaster preparedness.

**Project Background**


Rainfall is one of the most complex and difficult elements of the hydrology cycle to understand and model due to the complexity of atmospheric processes. In Bhutan, where the economy is heavily dependent on hydropower and agriculture, accurate rainfall forecasting is essential. Traditional statistical methods often fail to provide satisfactory accuracy due to the dynamic and nonlinear nature of rainfall. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative for improving prediction accuracy, enabling better decision-making in agriculture, disaster management, and water resource planning.

**Problem Statement**


Rainfall is one of the most complex and difficult elements of the hydrology cycle to understand and model due to the complexity of the atmospheric processes that generate rainfall and the tremendous range of variation over a wide range of scales both in space and time. Heavy rainfall prediction is a major problem for the meteorological department as it is closely associated with the economy and life of humans. It is a cause of natural disasters like floods and drought which are encountered by people across the globe every year. Accuracy of rainfall forecasting is important for countries like Bhutan whose economy is largely dependent on hydro-power projects and agriculture. Due to the dynamic nature of the atmosphere, Statistical techniques fail to provide good accuracy for rainfall forecasting. Thus, accurate rainfall prediction is one of the greatest challenges in operational hydrology. On a worldwide scale, different researchers have made numerous attempts to predict rainfall accurately using various techniques. However, due to the nonlinear nature of rainfall, the prediction accuracy obtained by these techniques is still below the satisfactory level.
